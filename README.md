# FIT5032 Internet Applications Development â€“ Eligibility Project

This project was completed as part of an eligibility demonstration for the Monash University unit **FIT5032: Internet Applications Development**.  
It follows **Project 2** from the tutorial: [The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xLMmNeLDY)

## Project Description

This project is a basic Vue 3 web application built using the **Composition API**, focusing on modular component-based architecture, reactive state management, and user interaction.

The tutorial guided me through setting up the Vue project, creating reusable components, managing form data, and applying core front-end development concepts.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:angiebb016/vue-project2-demo.git
