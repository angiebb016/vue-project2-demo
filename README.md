# FIT5032 Internet Applications Development â€“ Eligibility Project

This project was completed as part of an eligibility demonstration for the Monash University unit **FIT5032: Internet Applications Development**.  
It follows **Project 2** from the tutorial: [The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xLMmNeLDY)

## Project Description

This project is a basic Vue 3 web application built using the **Composition API**, focusing on modular component-based architecture, reactive state management, and user interaction.

The tutorial guided me through setting up the Vue project, creating reusable components, managing form data, and applying core front-end development concepts.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:angiebb016/vue-project2-demo.git
   cd vue-project2-demo

## Step 1: Create Vue Project using Vite

The project was scaffolded using Vite with Vue 3 and the Composition API. I named the project `NotesApp` and it is with the default settings without adding any optional or experimental features.

After creating the project, I installed dependencies and launched the development server. The app successfully started at `http://localhost:5173/`, confirming the setup was correct.

Below are screenshots of:
- The command-line creation process using `npm init vue@latest`
- The resulting folder structure in VS Code and the Vite server running
